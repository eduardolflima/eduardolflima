## Olá, sou Eduardo 👋

Infra → DevOps.
Estudando Git, Docker, Kubernetes e em janeiro começo AWS.
Aqui posto meus labs, testes e tudo que aprendo no caminho.

I’m a Backend Engineer focused on Developer Experience and one of the creators behind Cumbuca Dev — a community-driven initiative that empowers underrepresented groups through open source, career programs, and technical consulting. Through this work, we aim to actively promote and strengthen the open source ecosystem in Brazil.

I'm passionate about sharing knowledge and creating spaces where more people can thrive in tech.
